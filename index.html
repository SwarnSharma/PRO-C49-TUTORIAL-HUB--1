     <p>C is a popular, simple, and flexible general-purpose computer programming language. Dennis M Ritchie develops it in 1972 at AT&T. It is a combination of both low-level programming language as well as a high-level programming language. It is used to design applications like Text Editors, Compilers, Network devices, and many more.</p>
     
     <h3>Advantages</h3>
     <ul>
     <li>C language is easy to learn.</li>
     <li>It is fast, efficient, portable, easy to extend, powerful, and flexible programming language.</li>
     <li>It is used to perform complex calculations and operations such as MATLAB.</li>
     <li>It provides dynamic memory allocation to allocate memory at the run time.</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
     <ul>
     <li>In the C programming language, it is very difficult to find the errors.</li>
     <li>C does not support the concepts of constructors, destructors, abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation, and namespace like OOPs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>C++ is one of the thousands of programming languages that we use to develop software. C++ programming language is developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1980. It is similar to the C programming language but also includes some additional features such as exception handling, object-oriented programming, type checking, etc.</p>
     
     <h3>Advantages</h3>

     <li>C++ is a simple and portable structured programming language.</li>
     <li>It supports OOPs features such as Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation.</li>
     <li>It provides high-level abstraction and useful for a low-level programming language, and more efficient for general-purpose.</li>
     <li>C++ is more compatible with the C language.</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
     <ul>
     <li>C++ programming language is not secured as compared to other programming languages like Java or Python.</li>
     <li>C++ can not support garbage collection.</li>
